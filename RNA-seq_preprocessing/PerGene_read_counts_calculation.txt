#Per gene read counts were calculated as follows:

#Download annotation file
wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm6/bigZips/genes/dm6.ensGene.gtf.gz
gzip -d dm6.ensGene.gtf.gz

#Run featureCounts for each bam file separately
featureCounts -a dm6.ensGene.gtf -p -P -d 50 -D 1000 -B -T 64 -s 2 -o "FeatureCounts_output/output_file" "path/to/bam/alignmet" 

#Result data frames are provided in FeatureCounts_output
